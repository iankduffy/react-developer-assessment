## Notes 

### Setup

The repo set up didnt work with latest version of Node so I had to use nvm and node 16 to boot the empty app. 

First time using styled components, compared to using tailwind, CSS modules or SCSS 

  - Working out typescript and styled components took some time, but I know understand the concept.
