## Notes 

### Setup

The repo set up didnt work with latest version of Node so I had to use nvm and node 16 to boot the empty app. 

First time using styled components, compared to using tailwind, CSS modules or SCSS, which took a bit of time to learn. 

### State Mangagement 

I decided to use Zustand for state management, which I not used before but definitiy enjoyed using for this task. 

### What I do Differently 

- Would of done TDD from the start based on the specs in the readme
- Used SCSS / CSS modules as I not used styled components before (enjoyed trying learning it)
- Structure the Zustand Stores better (Zustand is a new statemanagment to me)

### Feedback 

- Task doesn't current boot on Node 18 which casued issues on my laptop 
- React Routers has changed with every version so developers might struggle with this (I done nextjs for 5 years so not needed it)
- Offered variantious of designs to build this task would help
- Really enjoyed the task as it was unique and let me learned new stuff - however did become long and complex.
